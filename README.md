# Don't Cross the Line
2 player game written in C.

My first ever programming project inspired from a mini-game in GTA 5.

Note: To be able to play this game your machine should have any C graphical Environment like Turbo-C etc.

Reason for creating this game:
- I was a part of AAC(Advanced Academic Center) in college during 1st year and at the end of the year my team had to do a mini-project.
- So, my friends and I wanted to do something new and different in our field of interest which is gaming.
- I watch a lot of video game gameplay on youtube, where I stumbled on to this hilarious video(https://youtu.be/qgq9jcxKHKM?t=433) and we replicated it in C graphics.

What I learnt from this:
- Understood what coding is all about.
- How to play with the flow of control in the program.
